# Introduction

This is high level analysis report of the Palmer Penguin Dataset collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman. 
The report will cover general analysis about the dataset, then will move into investigating the relationship between the physical characteristics of the different species of penguins. 

During the analysis we will try to answer the following questions:

* Is there a relationship between penguin's body mass and bill length?    

* Is there a relationship between penguin's body mass and flipper length?

* Does the sex, species or location of the penguin effect the physical characteristics?
